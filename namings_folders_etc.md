# A place for everything and everything in its place

e.g. 'cdq.animation' == cdq.entity.animation
or cdq.world.entity.animation ?

or 'world.entity.animation' ?

# World/stage/graphics/audio/controls theoretically different projects

> world project no gdx dependencies ! <

# cdq/ctx/audio, graphics, stage, world ???

# Make colors, icons, dependency graphs, dependency rules

# -> what is impl/API ? e.g. effects do I need all names? only for organization purpose ?

# txs?

# world-fns is again another context
    (only grid2d, utils, etc. ) ?
