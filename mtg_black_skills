A "Suicide Black" deck in Magic: The Gathering is often centered around a high-risk, high-reward strategy that uses aggressive creatures, powerful spells with life loss, and sacrifice effects to overwhelm the opponent. Translating this concept into Diablo II-inspired items and skills could yield a thrilling mix of dark, sacrificial, and self-harming abilities with significant rewards. Here are some item and skill ideas in that style:
