; Assumption: The map contains no not-allowed diagonal cells, diagonal wall cells where both
; adjacent cells are walls and blocked.
; (important for wavefront-expansion and field-following)
; * entities do not move to NADs (they remove them)
; * the potential field flows into diagonals, so they should be reachable too.
;
; TODO assert somewhere/at map load no NAD's and @ potential field init & remove from
; potential-field-following the removal of NAD's.

; TODO remove max pot field movement player screen + 10 tiles as of screen size
; => is coupled to max-steps & also
; to friendly units follow player distance
