; * entities with :z-order/flying are not flying over water,etc. (movement/air)
; because using potential-field for z-order/ground
; -> would have to add one more potential-field for each faction for z-order/flying
; * they would also (maybe) need a separate occupied-cells if they don't collide with other
; * they could also go over ground units and not collide with them
; ( a test showed then flying OVER player entity )
; -> so no flying units for now
