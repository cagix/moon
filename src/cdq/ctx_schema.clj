; Idea : if nothing is private, everything is in the right place!
; functions are tools
; dont' hide your tools
; then you know what you have created ... and nicely separated ...
; e.g. create truetype-font!!
; => e.g. don't hide your draw logic behind handle-draws! exposed in gdl , wired in cdq ?!

; 0. Move cdq.context and gdl.context together
; => its _pure wiring_
; => expose gdl objects independently , e.g. assets

; 1. create the q/defrecord with all fields here
; 2. extend step by step and see which 'ctx/' keys are used together -> ?
; => use gdl.utils/create-into!
