:schema into edn
into db or properties?

db/properties.edn
db/schema.edn

=> but finally its both just 'components'
=> data independent from code

=> first data - ....

'component-attrs' == 'properties-db' ?

An editor where you can add attributes

and properties are again just attributes w. schema ( map )
== > components

=> I could make assoc k :schema ... not to overwrite component-attrs
=> yeah why does it need to be in the code anyway
=> editor can then run without the application itself !?
=? only schema stuff ?

and then click on a component -> open source file ?
