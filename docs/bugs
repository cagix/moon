* blood curse (convert) does not trigger wakeup! -> forever sleeping

* movement speed -0.5% => you can see is just 2.995 instead of 3 for the rat after slow.

* dragon disappears after blood curse (convert ) ?

* trying to attack projectiles because damage effect no creature stats check (before hp check )

* libgdx actor usualy calls super on 'act' maybe thats why ui tooltip problems

* editor sound not playing currently selected (without resources/ )
