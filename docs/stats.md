* the whole stats/modifier/effects/foobar/schema thing is insane
* get back to drawing board
* What are my requirements ?
* cant give special name to value-text because val-inc/max-inc give same k ...


* Wait - an effect can just add/remove more ops
so change entity/modifiers ?

don't assoc a new base vaue!


! need tests !!

e.g. base hp 100 +50$ = 150 then

effect target max hp -50% =>
why do we do effects on max hp ? why not

then base 100 still with mods ... etc.

that means its a permanent mod ??

so we don't mod base-hp ?

val-max is just insanity ....
