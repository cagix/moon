* anvil.app/assets -> something I can make 'get' on with a string and returns libgdx Sound or Texture
  => is a var just pass 'assets' ???

* anvil.graphics/cached-map-renderer ->
  for a tiled-map returns a anvil.tiled-map-renderer/TiledMapRenderer
  => is a var just pass the memoized-fn

* cursors => just pass the cursors

* db -> pass db? make context-free db functins?

=> actually only 'create' needed ....
