#_(ns clojure.core)

; wait -
; then cannot create documentation
; with codox
; if I use clojure.core ?
; would have to do it manually
; or subtract
; just refer all is fine ...

(defn bind-root [avar value]
  (clojure.lang.Var/.bindRoot avar value))

(defprotocol Disposable
  (dispose [_]))

(declare asset-manager)


=> no more dependencies & cool
=> codox I can fix somehow or do myself
=> ? but on the other hand do I need everything everywhere???
