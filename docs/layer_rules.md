* libgdx -> bound by protocols input,app,graphics,audio, etc.
* interop -> bound by 'clojure.gdx'
* -> scene2d/ui will be interesting -> bound by 'cdq.stage' or 'cdq.ui' ?


; => so maybe the whole 'entity' is also only exposed through a protocol ?
; not even collides? etc. ?



Gdx/graphics -> 'cdq.graphics'
; -> camera, ui-viewport, don't use internal stuff

Make rules by grepping and visibility // layeres ....
