; remove main-menu / all screens - different apps (mapgen:test, db: editor/can do javafx)
; minimap:include ( ? )


; # 1. Remove main-menu screen

[ ] enter :player-dead => does not do anything now -> what should happen ? cannot call create world as dependend on concretions ....


=> next step also reduce UI elements



; # EDITOR APP
; => use those parts I need and only depend on _exactly_ what I need
; e.g. split up graphics only to depend on those stuffs I need over here
; => move all state inside editor.app ? use context-free functions otherwise??
; => only db/ui not?!
