* properties should be already build so the game does not have to depend on
db/ctx

* db/build only used at :tx/audiovisual & spawn-creature

  * spawn-enemies -> can build before and convert tiled map spawn positions
  * spawn-player-entity => pass with config, config is part of db??
    one-to-one with a creature?

  * damage -> audiovisuals/damage -> damage itself
  somehow also a property / the effect itself
  * target entity hit ground
  * creature destroy audiovisual ( can make easily into component )
