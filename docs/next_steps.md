* minimal test for fetch-relationships - fetch one-to-one, one-to-many ...
    (public fn somewhere ? )

    => remove other TODO's also out of the code and vars, hardcoded values.
        & organise

* animation only used @ entity animation component ? delete-after-animation stopped & cdq.animation move together?

* move multifns together e.g. malli-form (SCHEMA/TYPE)
    => somehow makes sense
        => cdq.schema remove too, all in db ?

* sound also only 'string', but different widget

* cdq.property/image -> give them proper images again no need for animation ( but audiovisuals need ? )
