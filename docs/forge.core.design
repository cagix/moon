; Rationale: defining in this project 100 times the same 'language' == aliases/refers...

; proliferation of types/names/etc
; just functions!
; e.g. draw/width/height/visible/...
; abstractions ... ?
; doesnt matter what kind of data I just have same fns - ...
; -> stuff finally can disappear
; accessing camera/viewport/tiledmap/actor via keywords to get data
; would be the end result?

; => actually it is also more like 'stable'
; or well define names.... working,...
