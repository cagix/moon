# Terrain

* Floor
  * 3 different stone with 5/7 variations [not implemented]
  * 12 more floors with 4 variations [ok]
  * 24 more floors without variations [not implemented]

* Walls:
  * 6 different with 6 variations each

* Water
  * 6 different with 4 variations (animated) [not implemented]


# Abstract modules

Create modules with 'floor, special-floor, wall, water'
=> the whole tiledmap chooses 1 floor, 1 wall

=> Or you just make your 6 levels
=> Handcrafted modules
=> I can re-use the winlu map
=> Divide creatures by 6 then too

=> But abstract modules would be much cooler ?
