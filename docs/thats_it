Thats it  -

you :Refer :all everywhere so load in clojure.core again

there no dependencies

every separate component is 'installed' or 'required-called'
and just defn-impl and stuff

nobody knows anything

then gdx/files or internal-file can even do sth like that

each _form_ can be separate even in some strange ways? if its adding to same language?

every form minimal dependencies at the right place - one langueage -

_NO BIG THINGS_
_EXACTLY EVERYTHING DEPEND ON EXACTLY WHAT IT  NEEDS AND NOT MORE_

this is fucking nuts

everything can actually disappear and be in the right place at the same time

and there is _one_ language?!

not need to require it again and again and define it again and again by refers and aliases

but then we can separate those dependency free namespaces in a few ?

e.g. context/cursors?
or what is cursors
just the cursors in my app

its blue so its fine

and then it will mean that each dpenedenc?! idk

=> then I organize things as of common imports e.g. 'Gdx/'
=> so either it is defn-impl or it is a component ....
and defn-impl could also be injected ala install ?
and then why not directly call the defn-impl guy
because we dont want to know where things come from?
no dependencies ....
then how to prove proper loading order?

=> no privates fns ... ?!
