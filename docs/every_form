* should be in its minimal context to understand it.
* the context is given by the namespace
* similar 'context' == similar namespaces

namespaces are not only containers for names but also define a context

=> what is our context?

e.g. imported 'AssetManager'
or 'imported 'ShapeDrawer'
=> then should contain only that.

=> should not be together/have tuff like other stuff
=> really minimal stuffs

e.g. malli context / schema forms ...
=> all together in 'malli' ?

new way to organize code ...
