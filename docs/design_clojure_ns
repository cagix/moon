; there is a mismatch with clojure/java-interop
; see asset-manager .get / ilookup or the 'set! of lwjgl3-config' (better as map-args)
; so the first layer 'called clojure.foo' is just an idiomatic API
; we could just do interop but because some of these cases are more smooth with an API
; we have to wrap the whole thing for consistency purposes
