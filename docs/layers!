*** first start-app ... app/ components => ground/root/gdx....
*** => then next layer (screens/entitiy/? => use app layer ?
and last layer is 'effects' => can have an ENTITY/APP API? or effects API ?

everything get an API!? idk

but for sure my app specific code doesnt need to know about gdx?
although I am checking gdx stuff ... clojure.gdx is already a layer over gdx?
