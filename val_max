  => Can I have 2 different numbers
  => How is the limiting done ?
    ( also for movement-speed, strength (not <0 ) ... )

    => max is just a limit ....
    => which is a separate stat
    => and current HP just after operations gets limited to the limit ...

    => str/movement-speed also ? dmg ?
