# Moon Engine

![moon 2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b1c666de-2aad-427f-b06a-c838048958bb)

Moon Engine is an open-source Action RPG-Maker written in [clojure](https://clojure.org/) and utilizing [libgdx](https://libgdx.com/) as a `backend`.

It supports a property-editor for all game relevant components like audiovisuals, creatures, items, skills, and ... effects/modifiers.

Everything is stored in a 'DATABASE' where stuff can be edited.... => So why not make it a separate project the 'moon.db' project?

## Levels

Levels can be created with [tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/) or procedurally or mixed with the use of modules. There is one example world for each approach.

## How to start

You need to have [leiningen](https://leiningen.org/) installed.

```
./dev
```

<details>
  <summary>Dev-loop contains:</summary>

* NREPL-Server
* On application close (ESC in the main menu), clojure.tools.namespace will do  refresh on any changed files and restart the app.
* On any error the JVM does not have to be restarted, you can fix the error and call `gdx.dev/restart!`
    * I have bound it on my VIM to F5 with: `nmap <F5> :Eval (do (in-ns 'gdx.dev)(restart!))`
